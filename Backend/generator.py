# Reset fails to zero after making it past a certain dead end...
# I still can't tell if it does reset to zero or not. ChatGPT brainwashed me into thinking it did...
#
# Here is how this works:
# Recursion until the board is filled (no zero's)
# The board does forward checking to pick a value for the sudoku cell that is now most constrained by
# it's neighbors. If a cell is found that now has no more options to pick from, we backtrack once more than
# we did last time (starting from 0). 
#
# Here is the refactoring opportunity. If a deadend happens that takes 3 undos, and then there is a
# future, independent, dead end that only takes one undo, well it's gonna do 4 now instead of just the one
# Figure out a way to reset the number of undos to zero once you've made it past a given dead end
